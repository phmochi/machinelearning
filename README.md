# Aspect Term Extractor
An end-to-end implementation of aspect term extraction from data handling and processing to modeling.

# sequence_generator
A library for generating images of sequences from the MNIST dataset that can be used to train a NN to recognize sequences of numbers rather than single digits. Check instructions.txt for details on how to use.

# ESN Regressor
Basic Echo state network (RNN implementation) for multitask regression problems.

# mnist_tensorflow
Case study for mnist in tensorflow. Basic single hidden layer model that achieves ~98% accuracy on test set (fluctuates between .979 and .981 depending on random) in ~2 minutes.

# mnist_numpy
Neural net in numpy, implementing SGD, l2 regularization, ReLU, xavier/he initialization, early stopping
